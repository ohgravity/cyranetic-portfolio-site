      <p>Many artists use website builders such as <a href="https://cargo.site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cargo</a> – think Squarespace or Wix but prettier and targeted toward designers and artists – to create their portfolio websites.
      One drawback, though, is that some flexibility of design is lost, as not all of the code/markup is visible/editable for
      the user. When I set out to build my portfolio site, I originally started working with a Cargo template, but
      increasingly found myself tweaking the code to better fit my style. I eventually hit a wall where I couldn’t change
      something because the code involved wasn’t editable. So, I decided I would probably be happiest in the long run by
      building from scratch, since I already had HTML and CSS knowledge. However, I soon realized that instead of simply
      clicking a button on Cargo to upload my art videos, I would need to figure out myself how to optimize video hosting. To
      be clear about who I think might benefit from reading this article, if you are an artist who knows some basics of
      front-end coding and would like total control over the look and function of your site, I am talking to you. If you don’t
      have much experience with HTML and CSS, though, it makes sense to simply use Cargo.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I think that video artists have special video hosting needs. For most people sharing videos online, the main concerns
        are ease of use and speedy loading – not video quality especially – and so for most of my online search about video
        hosting for artists, I was inundated with advice meant for marketers whose main concern is SEO. I recognized that there
        may be interest from other artist-coders about what is best for their needs, so I decided to write this article. Before
        researching this topic, I knew what options were out there, but I didn’t have a good idea of the contrasts between self-
        and remote- hosting, nor did I understand the critical differences between the different remote video host options out
        there. If you find yourself in the same situation, read on.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Options</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Firstly, there are many options in general for video hosting, from self-hosting with HTML’s video embed element, to
      using remote video hosts such as Youtube or Vimeo (<a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/video-hosting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">or several others</a>). While there are other video hosting platforms available, I will focus on the two that are most popular, Youtube and
      Vimeo. But first I will talk about my experience trying self-hosting.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>HTML's Video Embed Element</h3>
      <div class="image-container">
        <img class="blog-images" style="width:50%" src="../images/video-tag.png" alt="image of html video tag">
      </div>
      <p>Before I say anything else, I must point out that my videos, often music videos, tend to be several minutes long, with
      large file sizes. When I first started coding this site, I used the HTML video tag to feature the video on the homepage.
      Why? My video artwork tends to have many fine details and fast changes, requiring a high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bitrate</a> to look nice. Bitrate is essentially the number of bits that are conveyed or processed per unit of time during
      playback. I knew from past experience that Youtube, having a low bitrate and a lot of compression, mangled my videos’
      quality, so I thought I could preserve the original fidelity by self-hosting and escape all the detail-destroying video
      compression. I had also briefly tried using Vimeo to upload the video, but I found that I couldn’t alter the appearance
      of playback controls, logos, etc. overlaid onto the video, with my free account. So I went with the HTML video tag to
      get the more minimal interface I wanted.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, after consulting with a knowledgeable friend, I had severe doubts and then did some reading about how video
          bitrate and resolution impact loading speed, and how website domain hosts limit bandwidth. I also realized that if I
          want to use version control (Git) on my site, I need to keep the site lightweight in terms of file sizes. I don't want
          to go into detail, because it would require its own blog post, but do not even think about
          self-hosting large video files yourself and using Git LFS to store them for version control. Just don't even. I tried that during my problem-solving process, and later felt quite sheepish at the rabbit hole it took me down, but some professional programmer friends told me not to be embarrassed because it could happen to anyone who is just learning. Still, I want to save anyone I possibly can that particular trouble, because I am nice like that. So yes,
          version control must be taken into account. I will always try to find a free way to do something
          first, and sometimes that leads me down some convoluted processes. In this case, it ended in defeat but with valuable
          lessons learned. If you just want to self-host a few shorter videos, that could be fine, but limit them to 10 seconds
          each and reduce the file size with <a href="https://handbrake.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Handbrake</a> first. Also, consider including different 
          video encodings in your code to work with different browsers, as explained in great detail <a href="https://marekslipek.de/workshop/videokompression/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> 
          (translate to English if needed). Anyway, after reading about some video hosting platforms, I recognized that, for my video needs, if I want a
          good-looking and functional video interface on my site, I would need to pay for a service. The question now was which
          one to choose.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Youtube or Vimeo?</h3>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img class="blog-images" src="../images/youtube-vs-vimeo.png" alt="youtube logo, question mark, vimeo logo">
        </div>
      <p>The need to strike a balance between video quality and loading speed/playback performance is an artist's number one
      concern, and it is possible to agonize in many different ways in the quest for the best performance. To go completely
      down this rabbit hole requires a great deal of time and patience and probably isn't necessary for people running
      relatively small sites, so I will try to put forth only straightforward, easily actionable solutions. For one, you can
      possibly “cheat” in some cases <a href="https://zhestkov.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like this gorgeous example</a> by using a gif gallery 
      instead of video on a homepage that, when clicked, takes you to another page containing just one full video. Videos take 
      time to load to their full resolution, so it may be a good idea to limit or omit videos on a
      homepage. It makes sense to try to get your homepage to load fastest as it forms the first impression of your site for
      viewers, and yes, this affects your google search result rank.</p>
      <br>
      <p>As to which host I would choose between Youtube and Vimeo, the answer is clearly Vimeo.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Why Vimeo? <a href="https://www.azonetwork.com/marketing-science/blog/vimeo-vs-youtube-which-platform-is-best-for-hosting-video-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> is a good overview comparison between Youtube and Vimeo, and although it is focused more towards marketers, it is still
      a well-detailed general comparison. Because Vimeo has no ads and an array of privacy and embedding control options, as
      well as a higher bitrate to reduce the need for compression and to maintain crisp visual and audio quality, I recommend
      using Vimeo. Keep in mind, however, that the free plan does not offer all the above features. One very valuable benefit
      to using Vimeo is that you can re-upload a video without being penalized by losing the url and video-related comments
      and stats. So if you post a video, but later find a way to optimize the quality, or even decide to make slight edits in
      the content, you can do that without losing any stats from the time of first posting. That's huge! Not to mention the
      fact that you can restrict video embedding to happening only on your own personal website, and add your own personal
      branding, making it harder for people to falsely claim your art as theirs. There are even “Review Tools”, helpful for
      sharing a private (password-protected) work-in-process video with a client or collaborator to get notes.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Do What's Right For You</h3>
      <br>
      <p>I bought the lowest-tier paid hosting plan, which is perfect for an individual not running a large online operation, and
      am happy so far. In all fairness, though, there are a couple of drawbacks with Vimeo. For one, it will not fare as well
      in google search results as Youtube videos, as Youtube is owned by Google. For another, the cost is higher. For me,
      ~100USD/year is manageable to pay for excellent video hosting. However, if I were struggling financially, this cost
      could be outside of my reach. I truly wish that the best tech services were affordable to all, but that is unfortunately
      not the case. While I wanted to recommend the best-performing tech solutions with this article, I do not hesitate to say
      that if Youtube is your best option due to cost, use it! You can still make some edits to customize the interface, and
      it is still the best-performing video hosting service with regard to overall exposure, and you can monetize your videos.
      So if you can’t use Vimeo for any reason, don’t let that stop you from making the most beautiful website you can for
      your art. Your art deserves to be seen.</p>
