    <p>
      I am a programmer and digital artist based in Asia.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      As a self-taught programmer, I have experience with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Git. I also use Touch Designer, a node-based art programming environment. I built this site from scratch.

      As an artist and musician, I have experience with Touch Designer, Blender, After Effects, Photoshop, and Ableton Live. In university, I
      majored in Music with a focus on classical voice performance with additional studies in flute and English literature. A recently self-taught visual artist, I started out by creating 3D scenes in Glitchlab, a phone app, to while away the pandemic blues. In a short time, that developed into creating full-scale music video commissions for indie musicians, and other paid artwork. To bridge the gap between 3D art and web development, I will soon be learning Three.js. I designed my own logo and created it in Blender.
