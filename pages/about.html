    <p>
      I am an American digital artist, musician, and programmer based in Asia.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      As a self-taught junior programmer, I have experience with JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, and Git. I also use Touch Designer, a node-based art programming environment. I built this site myself.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      My formal education includes a BA in classical music. As a self-taught artist, I have experience with Touch Designer, Blender, Adobe video and image editing software, and Ableton Live. To bridge the gap between 3D art and web development, I will soon be learning Three.js and Unity. I want to move into making more interactive creative coding experiences for both online use and as physical art installations.
