    <p>
      As a digital artist, musician, and programmer, I am constantly exploring the intersection between technology and art. My background in classical music has taught me to appreciate the history, and various processes and approaches, that go into making music, and this awareness has carried over into my art and programming work.

    <p>
      I am a self-taught junior programmer with experience in various programming languages and environments, including JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, and Git. I also use Touch Designer, a node-based programming environment for creating interactive installations and online experiences.

      Fascinated by the limitless possibilities creative coding offers, my goal is to bridge the gap between 3D art and web development, creating immersive and interactive experiences that blur the lines between physical and digital spaces.
